# Hobby Web Application - QA Consultancy Individual Project

This project links was to create an API database of Comic Book Characters as I am a big collector for comic books.
The project is built on Maven using the Eclipse IDE with Spring Tool Suite 4, using JUnit, Selenium & Mockito for testing purposes. 
Version control was done using Git, with GitHub as host. 
A CI Server was set up, managed by Jenkins, to analyse code pushed to GitHub using SonarQube. The artifacts were stored on Nexus.
